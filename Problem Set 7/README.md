* 1.Define a "Create" function to declare a linked list with four node using dynamic memory allocation.Print the complete linked list after calling create function.
* 2.Define an "Empty" function to check whether the linked list is empty or not.
* 3.Define a "Size" function to find the size of the linked list.
* 4.Define a "Front" function to display the first element of the linked list.
* 5.Define back function to display the last element of the linked list.
* 6.Define a function to display the nth element of the Linked List. Take input 'n' from user. (Check index out of range)[let, the first element n=1].
* 7.Define a "Search" function to find a 'key' (take input 'key' from user). Print "Found" if the search 'key' is found in the Linked List otherwise print "Not Found".
* 8.Define a "Search" function to find a 'key' (take input 'key' from user). Return the position of the node if the search 'key' is found in the Linked List otherwise return -1.
* 9.Define a function to reverse the Linked List.(Donâ€™t use recursion}. Display both List before and after reversing.
* 10.Define a search function to reverse the linked list using recursion function.Display both list before and after reversing.
* 11.Copy a linked list into another linked list.Display both list before and after copy.(Don't use recursion).
* 12.Copy a linked list into another list with a recursion function Display both list before and after copy.
* 13.Define a function to merge two Linked List. Display all the list before and after merging.
* 14.Define a function to merge two sorted Linked List into a sorted Linked List. Display all the list before and after merging.
